## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Command substitution (`!command`) for API keys** — If an `api_key` value starts with `!`, the rest is executed as a shell command and stdout is used as the key. This enables integration with secret managers like 1Password, pass, or custom scripts.
  ```yaml
  # 1Password
  voxtral:
    api_key: "!op read 'op://Vault/Voxtral/key'"
  ```

  ```yaml
  # pass
  voxtral:
    api_key: "!pass show voxtral/api-key"
  ```

  ```yaml
  # GNOME Keyring
  voxtral:
    api_key: "!secret-tool lookup service mistral type api_key"
  ```
  - Supports shell pipes and quotes (`shell=True`)

  - Resolves after env vars and config file literals
